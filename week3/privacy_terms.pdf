The two services I chose to compare and contrast are Tik Tok and Instagram. 

Instagram collects the contect, communication and other information we provide, including messages and sign up. It also collects what we see when we use their cameras. It collects our usage, such as the type of content we engage with and the time and frequency of our engagement. They use this data to personalize features. The strange thing is that they also use the information of our activity off their products such as websites we visit in order to help advertisers measure the effectiveness of their ads. Third party apps that integrate with Instagram, like games, also receive information about us. Instagram is now removing developers’ access to our information if we have not used their app in three months. 

Tik Tok also collects technical and behavioral patterns about our use. They also collect information about us from third party sources. But they go further, collecting our IP addresses, models of our devices, our screen resolution and even our key stroke patterns. It knows our approximate location. They also say they do this to customize our ad experience. 

It seems that both services share our information in order to give us a more customized experience. However, I feel that Instagram is working harder to maintain their integrity in regards to privacy with measures like removing developers’ access after three months. From what it looks like, Tik Tok collects much more data about us than Instagram. Some of the data they collect is kind of surprising.
