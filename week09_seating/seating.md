The task of creating an algorithm to better help airlines seat passengers and not split up families comes with an inherent flaw. And the flaw is that airlines are purposely splitting apart families so they can upcharge. These are the first companies to ask for bail outs when the economy goes bad. These are the same companies that decreased seat size, that decreased food portions, that decreased luggage size. And now we're coming up with an ethical solution for them so that they can continue draining the customer of money while assuming no blame (it's not us, it's the algorithm!). 

No. The best solution to this is to have an application that runs in real time that is transparent. Here are the seats that are available. First come, first serve. You want better seats? Then go to first class. What is this economy upgrade BS? It's still just economy. And now if the customer knows that he has multiple people to account for, he/she would benefit from booking tickets early. 

Of course there are downsides to this. What if the family needs a rush flight, for example, to a funeral? Then they might have to be split up or they can take another flight. But I don't see why airlines can't be transparent? Why do we need a hidden algorithm that only the company knows about? Especially when we as tax payers have to bail them out repeatedly?
